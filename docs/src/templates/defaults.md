# Default Templates ðŸ§©

`aj init` seeds a couple of handy starters:

## `default.yaml`
```yaml
system_prompt: "You are Awful Jade, a helpful AI assistant programmed by Awful Security."
messages: []
```

## `simple_question.yaml`
```yaml
system_prompt: "Answer the user clearly and concisely."
messages: []
```

Use them asâ€‘is or as a base for your own.
