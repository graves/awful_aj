# Downstream Projects 🌱

Awful Jade (aj) isn’t just a one-off CLI toy—it’s a foundation. Because it’s built in Rust 🦀 with a clean separation of concerns (config, templates, sessions, memories, etc.), people can (and should!) build on top of it.

This page is a living showcase of projects that extend, remix, or depend on Awful Jade. Think of it as a family tree 🌳—where every branch adds a new capability, a new perspective, or just some another annoying edge case languishing in the issues tab.

## ✨ Why Downstream?
- Ecosystem Growth 🌍: `aj` handles the hard parts (embedding, sessions, vector search), so you can focus on the fun bits (_playing Bookclub Rummy in your terminal with Aristotle_).
- Composable by Design 🧩: Use `aj` as a CLI, a library, or a background service.
- Community-Driven 💬: The best projects come from folks solving their own problems—and sharing back.

## 🚧 Examples of What You Could Build

(Whether or not they already exist, these are the kind of things `aj` invites you adapt to your own needs!)

- Study Buddy 📚
    - A custom frontend where `aj` helps generate flashcards, quizzes, or summaries from your study materials.
- Terminal Therapist 🛋️
    - Hook `aj`’s interactive mode into your daily journal or notes app. Let it respond, remember, and gently roast you.
- Knowledgebase Copilot 🗄️
    - Wire `aj` into your company’s docs (Markdown, Confluence, Notion) and let it provide fast, context-aware Q&A.
- Creative Writing Sidekick ✍🏽
    - Use templates to inspire short stories, scripts, or dialogue. `aj` provides plot twists on demand.
- Rust Library Consumers 🔧
    - Import `aj` as a [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/awful_aj) (`awful_aj`) and embed it into your own CLI, TUI, or service.
