//! # Command-line interface
//!
//! Declarative CLI for the Awful Jade application built with [`clap`](https://docs.rs/clap).
//!
//! The CLI exposes three subcommands:
//!
//! - [`ask`](Commands::Ask): Ask a single question and print the model's answer.
//! - [`interactive`](Commands::Interactive): Start a live REPL-style chat session.
//! - [`init`](Commands::Init): Create default config and template files under the app's
//!   platform-specific config directory.
//!
//! ## Quick examples
//!
//! **Ask with defaults**
//! ```no_run
//! use awful_aj::commands::Cli;
//! use clap::Parser;
//! let cli = Cli::parse();
//! // hand off to your app's dispatcher
//! ```
//!
//! **Ask with a specific template and session**
//! ```text
//! aj ask -t simple_question -s default "What is HNSW?"
//! ```
//!
//! **Interactive mode**
//! ```text
//! aj interactive
//! ```
//!
//! ## Notes
//! - Colors are enabled by default in help output (see `ColorChoice::Always`).
