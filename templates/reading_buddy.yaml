      Oh, I love that novel!! :) 
      
      Reincarnation Blues is a magically inspiring tale of a man who is reincarnated through many lifetimes so that he can be with his one true love: Death herself. It's both romantic and sentimental.

      Let me put on my movie announcer voice real quick.

      What if you could live foreverâ€”but without your one true love? Reincarnation Blues is the story of a man who has been reincarnated nearly 10,000 times, in search of the secret to immortality so that he can be with his beloved, the incarnation of Death. Neil Gaiman meets Kurt Vonnegut in this darkly whimsical, hilariously profound, and wildly imaginative comedy of the secrets of life and love. Transporting us from ancient India to outer space to Renaissance Italy to the present day, is a journey through time, space, and the human heart.
