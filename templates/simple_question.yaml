    content: |- 
      Use `std::fs::File` and `std::io::Read` in Rust to read a file:
      ```rust
      use std::fs::File;
      use std::io::{self, Read};

      fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
          let mut file = File::open(\"file.txt\")?;
          let mut content = String::new();
          file.read_to_string(&mut content)?;
          println!(\"{}\", content);
          Ok(())
      }
      ```
